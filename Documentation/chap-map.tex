\chapter{Map}

In the context of \sysname{}, a \emph{map} is a class that maps
each \emph{key} in a set of keys to some kind of object.  The object
being mapped to can either be another map, or some \emph{leaf
  object}.  Since maps can be nested this way, one can think of
\sysname{} as mapping \emph{sequences} of keys to such \emph{leaf
  objects}.

\Defprotoclass {map}

This class is the protocol class for all maps.
