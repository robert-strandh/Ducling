\section{Purpose}

\sysname{} is a library that provides a data structure that can be
thought of as a multi-level map.  As such, it takes a sequence of
objects and either returns an object or reports failure.

The objects in the sequence are typically supplied one at a time, and
at each stage in the process, it is possible to issue a query to
determine what possible next object will result in a success.

The typical use case for this library, which is why it was writtin, is
to map sequences of keystrokes to commands in an Emacs-like text
editor
(\cite{GNUEmacsLispReferenceManual,CraftOfTextEditiing,Finseth:1980:TPTa}).
