\chapter{Package}

A single package named \texttt{ducling} is provided by \sysname{}.  We
recommend that this package not be used (in the sense of
\texttt{use-package} or the \texttt{:use} option to
\texttt{defpackage}) by client code.  Instead we recommend using
explicit package prefixes whenever a symbol in the \texttt{ducling}
package is referred to by client code.

The reason for this recommendation is that the package named
\texttt{ducling} exports (and therefore also \emph{shadows}) names
that would class with names of symbols in the package named
\texttt{common-lisp}.  Furthermore, we reserve the right to add more
such names in the future.

Alternatively, client code can selectively import documented names
from the package named \texttt{ducling} as long as names that class
with symbols in the \texttt{common-lisp} package are properly
shadowed.  This technique may not be practical if, for instance,
client code needs to simultaneously refer to the symbol
\texttt{ducling:map} and the symbol \texttt{common-lisp:map}.
